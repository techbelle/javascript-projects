    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
   
    <div><h1>Variables</h1>
        let interestRate = 0.3; //Number Literal
        let isApproved = true; //Boolean Literal 
        let firstName = undefined; //havent received yet
        let lastName = null //explicitly clears the value of the variable. indicates no selection
        
    </div>
    <div><h1>Objects</h1>
    Multiple related variables are inside of an object. For example, a person. Name, birthdate, etc.
   
    let person = {
        name: 'Mosh'; //String Literal
        age: 37;
    }

    //Dot Notation or Bracket Notation
    person.name = 'Rachelle';  //Cleanest, easiest method
    person['name']= 'Mary'; //if you think this value might change at runtime, brackets.

    </div>
    <div><h1>Arrays</h1>
        let selectedColors =['red','blue'];  
        //This is an array, which is just a list of stuff
        selectedColors[2]='green';
        //Remember, in an array, the first entry is 0, so red.blue,green is 0,1,2 
        //Arrays have properties, magically inherited, called "prototypes"
        
        console.log(selectedColors.length); //Will tell you the number of items in an array
    
    
       <h1>Variables</h1>
        // Cannot be a reserved keyword
        // Should be meaningful
        // Cannot start with a number
        //Cannot contain a space or hyphen, and use camelcase
        //These are case sensitive firstName FirstName are different things
        //Should be declared on separate lines, term'd with a ;
        //Start with let
        //Two types, references and primitives
    
    
        //Constants
        //start with const
        //should be your default choice unless you think this value will change
    
    //Javascript is a dynamic language, which means the value type can change at runtime
    // all numbers are of type number, instead of numbers or floating point integers
    
    
     <h1>Functions</h1>
     A set of statements that perform a task or calculates a value
     function greet(){
        console.log('Hello there!');
    }
    greet();
    //To calculate a value
    What's a parameter vs argument (the argument is the actual value of the parameter)
    function square(number){
        return number * number;
    }
    let number = square (2)
 console.log(number)
<h1>Operators</h1>
There are multiple kinds of operators. Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical, Bitwise.</br>
* Arithmetic = addition, substraction, division, remainder, multiplication, exponents (two stars)</div><br>
* Increment  (++)<br>
* Decrement (--)<br>
* Assignment is the equals sign (+=). Where x=x+3 is the SAME as x *=3<br>
* Comparison Operators. Greater than, less than. For example, let x = 1; console.log (x>0); will output "true"<br>
*- Relational or Equality operators. Equality is three equal signs ===, not equal is !==, like x !==1 means "check if x is not equal to one"<br>
Strict equality operators is === means have to be same type, same value. '1' vs 1 is NOT equal, because it's a string vs number.

<h1>Ternary Operators</h1>
example: if a customer has more than 100 points, they are a gold customer, otherwise silver.
let points = 110
let type = points > 100 ? 'gold' : 'silver'
Start with condition, if true then use first value.
console.log(type);

<h1>Logical Operators</h1>
<b>AND &&</b> <br>
Returns true if both operands are true<br>
Example: you want to build a situation where if both A and B are true, the customer gets something.
let highIncome = true
let goodCreditScore = true
let eligibleForLoan = highIncome && goodCreditScore;
console.log(eligibleForLoan);
(will output 'true')
 <br>
<b>OR ||</b>
if either operand is true, then it outputs true
let eligibleForLoan = highIncome || goodCreditScore;
<br>
<b>NOT !</b>
let applicationRejected = !eligibleForLoan;
<br>
<h1>Logical Operators with Non-Booleans</h1><br>
Falsy = undefined, null, 0, NaN, ''<br>
Truthy = anything not Falsy<br>
example: user must pick a drink choice. if they don't pick anything, they get water.<br>
let userChoice = 'wine';<br>
let defaultChoice = 'water';<br>
let currentChoice = userChoice || defaultChoice;<br>
console.log (currentChoice);<br>
<h1>Operators Precedence</h1><br>
let x = 2+3*4<br>
if you do console.log (x); it will show 14.<br>
if you want things to be processed in certain order, you should use parenthesis, just like in mathematics.
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<h1>If...Else</h1>
If hour is between 6-12pm Good morning! If between 12pm and 6pm, Good Afternoon. Or, display Good night!
<br>
if (condition)... is true{<br>
    statement is executed<br>
}<br>
else if (anotherCondition){<br>
a different statement<br>
}<br>
if none of these are true... else<br>
<br>
<code>
    let hour = 10;
    if(hour >=6 && hour < 12) {
    console.log('Good morning');
}
</code>
<br>
<h1>Switch Case</h1>
switch (role){
case 'guest': 
 console.log('Guest User')
 break;
 case 'moderator':
 console.log ('Moderator User')
 break;
}<br>213343
<h1>For</h1>
To repeat an action a number of times, we use loops. For loops, while loops, do while loops, for...in loops, for ... of loop.<!DOCTYPE html>
<br>
<h1>Infinite Loops</h1>
a loop you usually accidentally build, that will crash your browser, because you didn't set up incrementing correctly
while (true) {<br>
something that is always true...}<br>
AVOID AVOID AVOID<br>
<h1>For-In</h1>
We've so far learned, For Loops, While Loops, and Do-While Loop. There's also <For-In class=""></For-In>
const person = {
name: 'Rachelle',
age: 37
};
<br>
contrast<br>
for (let key in person)<br>
in every iteration, the key variable in the loop will be the properties of person<br>

Two ways to access properties <b>Dot Notation</b> or <b>Bracket Notation</b>.
person.name or person ['name']
<br>
Can also iterate over an array like const colors = ['red','green','blue'];
for (let index in colors)
console.log(index, colors[index]);
<br>
ES6 is the modern version of Javascript. But for-of loops are better for arrays.<br>
If you want to loop through elements of an array, use FOR OF
<b>for (let color of colors);</b>
<br>
<h1>Break and Continue</h1>
to get out of all these loops, use the 'break' keyword.
<i> if (i === 5), break;</i><br>
<hr>
<h1>Exercises...Max of Two Numbers</h1>
You'll discover there are many ways to do things.
<code>
        let x = 50
        let y = 65
        if (x>y){
            console.log(x);
        }
        else if (x < y){
            console.log(y);
        }
<br>
        //the other way to do this is
        let number = max(50,65);
        console.log(number);
        function max (a, b){
            if (a>b) return a;
            else return b;
        }
    <br>    
        //the other way to do this is with the Ternary Operator
        let anotherNumber = max (50,65);
        console.log(anotherNumber);
        function max(a,b){
            return (a>b) ? a : b;
        }
</code>
<br>
<br>
Exercise 2... returning true and false.
<code>
        let width = 1000
        let height = 100
        console.log ('isLandscape');
        function isLandscape(width, height){
            return (width>height) ? width : height;
        }
        <br>

LOOKS BETTER AS<br>
let width = 1000
        let height = 100
        console.log ('isLandscape');
        function isLandscape(width, height){
            return (width>height);
        }
<br>
STILL BETTER
console.log (isLandscape(100,1000));
function isLandscape(width,height){
return (width > height);
}
<br>
